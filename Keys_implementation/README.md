1) Function that calculates the key space for each key length[8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096].
2) Function that generates a random key value, which is in the range 0x00...0 to 0xFF...F depending on the selected key length.
3) Simple brute-force function implementation; will become slower as the key length and key space increase. This is because the number of possible keys will increase exponentially with the key length, making the brute-force search more time-consuming. In real-world cryptography applications, brute-force attacks are often unfeasible due to the large key space and the need for secure key generation and protection.
